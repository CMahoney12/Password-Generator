# Password-Generator

This password generator is designed to create passwords for its user.


## Description:

A password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. If outside the range of 8 - 128, the user is prompted to once again enter a password length within the range. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number.

The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.


## Getting Started:

### Executing program:

* Click red "Generate Password" button
* Choose number between 8 - 128 in popup for length of password
* Determine through the following popup boxes if you want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters
* Once all parameters have been defined, a password will generate within the password box
* The user can now copy their randomly generated password for using.
